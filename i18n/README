[CAN'T BE USED YET, WIP]

==================== I18N BOT ========================

A service bot for registering a language as user's
language so it can be accessed by other bots which
uses this service. The idea is to be a public and
centralised solution for the locale settings of user.

WORKFLOW:
> User sets a language in this bot.
# Other bot does <GET /:user_id> to this server.
< The language set by the user is returned. If the
  user haven't set any, the 'ok' response parameter
  will be false.
> Other bot starts to message to the user in that
  language.

I prefer the "Other bot" to have a language setting in
itself so if the user need to change the language for
that bot alone, it can be done.

(Will write more about this )
