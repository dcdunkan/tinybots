[INCOMPLETE! WIP]

=============== CC (CARBON-COPY) BOT =================

Just /start the bot. If anyone in a chat where the bot
is also a member /cc some users to/in a message, they
will get notifications about it. To be more specific,
they'll get a carbon-copy of the message. Mentioned
users doesn't need to be in the group - that's a goal.

@pinging is enough, of course. But it doesn't work for
the users that are not in the group.

CC? HOW??
Example message:

Seems like a possible fix for the issue.
/cc @user1 text_mention_of_user2.

(Or you can /cc as a reply message.)

NOTE: CCs are only send to the mentioned ones in the
same line as the /cc command.
