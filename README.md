Hi. I'm Dunkan and this is where I keep my small Telegram bots. Most of
them might be incomplete in code, but I try to write about the idea of that bot
in their respective READMEs, as this is also a place for plotting the ideas.

Feel free to take the work-in-progress bots or the raw ideas, if you like it. If
you managed to complete, consider opening a pull request with a link to it.

If you are interested, you can join [the Telegram channel](https://t.me/dcbots)
where I post about the bots that I create and host.
