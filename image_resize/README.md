# Image Resize Bot

Bot for resizing images to a given height and width. I had to make this because
a lot of friends once needed this for some registration purposes. So, we've like
photos of the person and signature. And all these college/government websites
has strict and very different limits on the files we're uploading. So, they kept
sending me those images to resize it for them :/

Could've used some website (there are plenty of them). But didn't. Instead, I
wrote a script that can do the resizing. With some slight modification, this bot
was born. I made it ready for more general purpose use. Never hosted it tho.
